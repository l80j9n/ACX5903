PART A
1.       Use   an   accounting   worksheet   to   analyse   transactions   and   balance-day   adjustments   for   the   month's   activities,   then   record   it   in   an   excel   worksheet.   An   Excel   worksheet   to   assist   you   is   available   on   Moodle.
2.       Based on your worksheet, prepare the Income   Statement, Balance Sheet, and Statement of   Cash   Flows.   Show all calculations. Please refer to the formats in the prescribed textbook.
3.      Calculate   the   profit   if   the   business   uses   cash   accounting.   Show   all   calculations.   Compare   the   profit from cash and accrual accounting for the business and give 3 reasons why the   amounts are   different.   Explain which accounting method is better for the business in your   datasheet.

4       Income Statement for the month of June                                                                          8

Note:
•          Use the Notes column of   the Worksheet to describe the type of expense and income -   this will make your preparation of   the Income   Statement easier;
•          You may   need   to add   the   column   headings   of   the   accounting   worksheet   (i.e.   the   account   names) and/or add columns/rows;
•          You   must   show   and   explain   your   calculation   of   the   values   of   all   adjusting   entries.   This   can   be provided either in the Worksheet or on separate pages;
•          Formatting: ensure it fits well on   an A4 page   and   is readable   at   Moodle;
•          The Statement of Cash Flows must be classified, i.e. cash flows must be shown in the   categories   of   operating, investing, and   financing   cash   flows;
•          You must use   the Direct Method   to   prepare the Statement of   Cash Flows.   Show all calculations;
•          Round   all   monetary   amounts   to   the   nearest   dollar;
•          All   non-current   assets   are   depreciated   using   the   straight-line   method.
PART BPart   B   consists   of   a 15-minute   quiz. The skills and knowledge required for the task are   relevant to those required   for Part   A.   The   questions   are   either   multiple   choice   questions   or   calculation questions.
